# üßÖ Toralizer: SOCKS4 Proxy Client in C

**Toralizer** is a lightweight SOCKS4 proxy client written in C that allows you to connect to any target IP and port through a SOCKS4 proxy ‚Äî such as the Tor network (`127.0.0.1:9050`). It is useful for penetration testing, anonymity routing, and network experiments.

## ‚ú® Features

- Connects to any IPv4 host through a SOCKS4 proxy
- Compatible with the Tor proxy
- Minimal C implementation with no external dependencies
- Useful for testing Tor connectivity and proxy setups

---

## üîß Requirements

- GCC or any C compiler
- Linux or Unix-like OS (macOS, WSL, etc.)
- Tor (if routing through the Tor network)

 >> gcc toralizer.c -o toralizer 


üöÄ Usage

./toralizer <destination_ip> <destination_port>
Example
./toralizer 93.184.216.34 80


CONNECTION ESTABLISHED TO PROXY
Successfully connected through proxy to 93.184.216.34:80
üîç SOCKS4 Request Format
The proxy request structure follows the SOCKS4 protocol:
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+....+----+
| VN | CD |   DSTPORT   |     DSTIP      |  USERID     |NULL|
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+....+----+
VN: SOCKS version number (0x04)

CD: Command code (0x01 for CONNECT)

DSTPORT: 2 bytes, big-endian

DSTIP: 4 bytes

USERID: Null-terminated string (up to 8 bytes)

üß™ Testing with Tor
Start the Tor service:

sudo service tor start
By default, Tor listens on 127.0.0.1:9050 as a SOCKS proxy.

Then run:

./toralizer <target_ip> <port>
To test against example.com, convert its domain to IP first:

host example.com
‚ùó Troubleshooting
connect: Connection refused ‚Üí Tor isn't running on port 9050

Unable to traverse the proxy, error code: 91 ‚Üí Request was rejected by the proxy
